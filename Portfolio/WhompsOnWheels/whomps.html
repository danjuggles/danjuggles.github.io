                <h2>Sustainable by Design</h2>
                <p>Whomps on Wheels isn't just about great sound and vibrant light shows, it's about eco-conscious entertainment. We've made sustainability a core part of our design, using biodegradable insulation for all wiring, integrating solar panels for an efficient, renewable power source, and used scrap/salvaged material wherever possible. We carbon offset the entire build, as well as the ongoing useage. This battery-operated, sustainable stage not only lowers your carbon footprint but also never skips a beat.</p>
